Text-Based Minesweeper Game in C

For this project, I engineered a text-based Minesweeper game in C with a focus on efficient board generation, mine placement, and a user-friendly interface.

To ensure an engaging player experience, I designed and implemented the board initialization function. This function ensures a balanced distribution of mines across the board, creating challenging but fair gameplay.

I also developed a display function that provides players with a clear and visually appealing representation of the Minesweeper grid. This function enhances the user interface, making it easier for players to navigate and interact with the game.

Throughout the development process, I addressed challenges in mine placement algorithms to enhance the game's randomness while maintaining playability. By overcoming these challenges, I was able to create a Minesweeper game that offers both enjoyable gameplay and a satisfying user experience.
